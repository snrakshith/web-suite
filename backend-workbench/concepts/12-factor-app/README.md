# 12 Factor App

The 12-factor methodology is a set of best practices for developing modern, cloud-native applications.

By following these principles, you can build `scalable`, `maintainable`, and `portable microservices` with Node.js that are well-suited for cloud-native architectures.

- It provides guidelines for building scalable, maintainable, and portable microservices.
- Each factor represents a specific aspect of application development and deployment that contributes to its overall effectiveness.

Here's an example of how you can apply the 12-factor principles to a Node.js-based microservice:

1. Codebase: Maintain a single codebase for each microservice.

   - For example, you can create a Node.js project using a version control system like Git.

2. Dependencies:

   - Declare and manage dependencies explicitly.
   - Use a package manager like npm to define and manage the dependencies of your Node.js project.

3. Config:

   - Store configuration settings in the environment
   - Instead of hardcoding configuration values in your code, use environment variables to dynamically configure your Node.js microservice.

4. Backing services:

   - Treat backing services (databases, queues, etc.) as attached resources.
   - For instance, if your Node.js microservice requires a database, connect to it via environment variables or configuration files rather than hardcoding the connection details.

5. Build, release, run:

   - Separate the build, release, and run stages.
   - Use build tools like npm scripts to build your Node.js project, create a release package, and then deploy and run the application in your target environment.

6. Processes:

   - Execute the application as stateless processes.
   - Node.js is well-suited for this as it naturally supports an event-driven, non-blocking execution model.

7. Port binding:

   - Export services via port binding.
   - In a Node.js microservice, you can expose your API through a specific port and listen for incoming HTTP requests.

8. Concurrency:

   - Scale out via the process model.
   - Node.js can handle concurrency by utilizing its event loop and asynchronous nature, allowing you to scale your microservice by adding more instances.

9. Disposability:

   - Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown.
   - Ensure your Node.js microservice starts up quickly and handles shutdown gracefully, allowing for easy scaling and updates without affecting the overall system.

10. Dev/prod parity:

    - Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible.
    - Use containerization tools like Docker to create consistent development and production environments for your Node.js microservice.

11. Logs:

    - Treat logs as event streams.
    - Implement proper logging mechanisms in your Node.js microservice to capture important events and information.

12. Admin processes:
    - Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
    - Use separate Node.js scripts or CLI tools to handle administrative tasks, such as database migrations or system maintenance.
