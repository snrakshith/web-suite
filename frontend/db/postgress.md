When categorizing PostgreSQL tasks under "Easy," "Medium," and "Difficult" for different job positions (Junior, Mid, Senior), the complexity and depth of the tasks typically increase with experience and responsibilities. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

### **Junior Level (Entry-Level)**

- **Easy**
  - Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using SQL.
  - Understanding table schemas and basic data types (e.g., `INTEGER`, `VARCHAR`, `BOOLEAN`).
  - Writing simple SELECT queries with filters (`WHERE`, `LIMIT`, `ORDER BY`).
  - Understanding primary keys and basic indexing.
  - Basic JOIN operations between tables.
- **Medium**
  - Understanding foreign key constraints and simple relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many).
  - Writing more complex SQL queries using multiple JOINs and subqueries.
  - Creating and modifying tables, indexes, and constraints.
  - Handling null values and default values.
  - Importing and exporting data (e.g., using `COPY` command).
- **Difficult**
  - Optimizing simple queries (e.g., using indexes efficiently).
  - Basic understanding of transactions and rollbacks.
  - Writing basic views and functions.

### **Mid-Level (Intermediate)**

- **Easy**
  - Writing advanced queries with window functions and complex `GROUP BY` clauses.
  - Designing more complex relationships (many-to-many).
  - Working with PostgreSQL sequences and managing auto-incrementing fields.
- **Medium**
  - Creating and using stored procedures and functions (PL/pgSQL).
  - Working with triggers.
  - Query optimization with `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE`.
  - Implementing and managing indexes efficiently (e.g., partial and composite indexes).
  - Managing PostgreSQL roles and permissions.
- **Difficult**
  - Understanding and implementing transaction isolation levels and locking mechanisms.
  - Working with JSONB and advanced data types (arrays, enums, etc.).
  - Handling migrations in a production database.
  - Designing scalable database schemas for high availability and performance.

### **Senior Level (Advanced)**

- **Easy**
  - Advanced database design for large-scale applications.
  - Managing replication and backups (logical and physical replication).
  - Monitoring and tuning PostgreSQL performance in production.
- **Medium**
  - Implementing advanced indexing strategies (e.g., GIN, GiST, BRIN).
  - Partitioning large tables and managing table inheritance.
  - Setting up high-availability configurations (e.g., clustering, replication).
- **Difficult**
  - Sharding and distributed PostgreSQL architecture (e.g., using Citus).
  - Designing and implementing disaster recovery plans.
  - Handling complex migrations and schema changes in live environments with minimal downtime.
  - Deep understanding of PostgreSQL internals (e.g., MVCC, vacuuming, WAL).
  - Implementing advanced security features (SSL, role-based access control, row-level security).

This categorization can guide expectations based on the skill levels at different career stages.
