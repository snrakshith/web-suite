# JS Call Stack

- who it works
- why we should care, bcz
  - its fundamental to how JS works
  - its helpfull for debugging
  - its comes down in all stack

# Stack definitation:

- An ordered set of stack frames
- Hot recently invoked functions is on the top of the stack
- The bottom of the stack is the first function invoked
- The stack is processed from top to bottom

# Recursion:

- It is just an approach to solve a problem
- 2 Essentials parts of a recursion function
  - Base case: The condition when the recursion end.
  - different inputs
- Iterator vs Recursion
  - Remeber the village boy & the dragon story.
  - Recursion: A process (a function in our case) that calls itself.
  - How recursive function work invoked a same function with different parameters. untill you reach a base case.

# Big O Notation

- Its important to have a precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performance.
- Usefull for discussing trade-offs btw different approaches.
- Almost asked in every interview
- It helps in knowing where exactly

  - your code slows down or crashes
  - Identify parts of the code that are inefficient in our applications

- What does better mean ?
  - faster
  - more readable
  - less memory intensive
