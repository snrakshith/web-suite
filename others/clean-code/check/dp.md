Design patterns can be categorized based on their purpose and the specific problem they address in software design. The three main categories are **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** patterns. Each category focuses on a different aspect of object-oriented design:

### 1. Creational Patterns

**Purpose:** Deal with object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

- **What They Solve:** These patterns help in abstracting the instantiation process, making the system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.
- **Common Patterns:**
  - **Singleton:** Ensures a class has only one instance.
  - **Factory Method:** Creates objects without specifying the exact class.
  - **Abstract Factory:** Creates families of related or dependent objects.
  - **Builder:** Constructs complex objects step by step.
  - **Prototype:** Creates new objects by copying existing ones.

### 2. Structural Patterns

**Purpose:** Deal with object composition and relationships, focusing on simplifying the structure by identifying the relationships.

- **What They Solve:** These patterns help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn’t need to change.
- **Common Patterns:**
  - **Adapter:** Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
  - **Bridge:** Separates an object’s abstraction from its implementation.
  - **Composite:** Organizes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
  - **Decorator:** Dynamically adds behavior to an object.
  - **Facade:** Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
  - **Flyweight:** Minimizes memory use by sharing as much data as possible.
  - **Proxy:** Controls access to an object, adding a layer of indirection.

### 3. Behavioral Patterns

**Purpose:** Deal with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- **What They Solve:** These patterns manage the communication and interaction between objects, ensuring that systems remain flexible and extensible.

- **Common Patterns:**
  - **Chain of Responsibility:** Passes a request among a chain of handlers.
  - **Command:** Encapsulates a request as an object.
  - **Interpreter:** Implements a specialized language.
  - **Iterator:** Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially.
  - **Mediator:** Reduces the direct communication between objects by using a mediator.
  - **Memento:** Captures an object’s state so it can be restored later.
  - **Observer:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects.
  - **State:** Allows an object to change its behavior when its state changes.
  - **Strategy:** Defines a family of interchangeable algorithms.
  - **Template Method:** Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses.
  - **Visitor:** Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.

### Alternative Categories

While the Creational, Structural, and Behavioral categories are the most common, design patterns can also be categorized in other ways:

- **Scope-Based Categorization:**

  - **Class Patterns:** Deal with relationships between classes and their subclasses. These relationships are established through inheritance.
  - **Object Patterns:** Deal with object relationships, which can be changed at runtime.

- **Problem-Based Categorization:**
  - **Concurrency Patterns:** Focus on multi-threaded programming and the coordination between threads (e.g., Thread Pool, Double-Checked Locking).
  - **Architectural Patterns:** Deal with the overall layout of large-scale software applications (e.g., MVC, Microservices).

This classification helps in understanding the specific focus and application of each design pattern within software development.
