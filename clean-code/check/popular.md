Here are some of the most popular and widely used design patterns in each category:

### Creational Patterns

1. **Singleton**

   - Frequently used when only one instance of a class is needed, such as in logging, configuration settings, or managing connections.

2. **Factory Method**

   - Commonly used in frameworks where the exact class of the object that needs to be created isnâ€™t known until runtime.

3. **Builder**
   - Often used when an object needs to be constructed with many optional parameters or complex construction steps, like when creating complex objects in a readable way.

### Structural Patterns

1. **Adapter**

   - Commonly used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code, particularly when integrating with legacy systems.

2. **Decorator**

   - Frequently used to add behavior or responsibilities to objects dynamically, often seen in I/O streams in Java or UI component frameworks.

3. **Facade**
   - Widely used to provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use and understand.

### Behavioral Patterns

1. **Observer**

   - Commonly used in event-driven systems where objects need to be notified of changes in other objects, such as in UI frameworks.

2. **Strategy**

   - Often used to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable, particularly in situations where a class behavior needs to change dynamically.

3. **Command**

   - Widely used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event, often seen in implementations of undo/redo functionality or GUI buttons.

4. **State**
   - Commonly used to allow an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes, frequently seen in workflow management or game development.

These patterns are popular due to their versatility and applicability in solving common design problems across various domains.
