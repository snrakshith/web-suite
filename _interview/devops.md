AWS Questions

Q - what is AMI?

A - AMI is an Amazon machine image mainly contains operating system and configuration files which is mainly used to deploy multi virtual machines, regardless of any AWS region

Q- what is EC2 instance , and what are the types?

A- EC2 is a virtual machine that represents your physical machine for you to deploy an application
General purpose, compute optimised, memory, optimised, accelerated, compute instance, storage optimisation, instance

Q-Different types of storage ?

A elastic block storage, instant storage, both comes under block storage itself only

File storage : elastic file system and then AWS FSx
Elastic file system is mainly used for Linux operating system. Aws fSx is mainly useful Windows operating system.

Object Storage -S3, glacier.

Challenges with instant storage-it’s a temporary storage data will be lost if you stop and start the instance
Fixed size and type
Only available with the selected Instance types
Cannot detach and attach to other virtual machines
Advantage of EBS-permanent or persistent storage
Can be increased to 16 TB
available in different types, like SSD and HDD
EBS is available to all servers
Can be detached attached to others

Q-What are the different types of load balances?

A- Application load balancer works on HTTP and HTTPS protocol and network load balancer works on TCP and UDP protocol. Even application load balancer works on TCP protocol, but application load balancer doesn’t support UDP.
Because UDP is very efficient protocol when we are using streaming application or online meetings or any sort of streaming things, it is very useful. This is not supported by application load balancer. This is the major difference.

The major disadvantage with the network load balance is HTTP to https direction is not possible and also web application file was not supported.

Q- what are the different types of auto skilling groups we do have?

A- vertical scaling -increasing resource of existing servers, example T2 micro 2 T2 large needs to stop and start if we have multiple servers and we want to change the size of the instance it is not possible so we choose horizontal scaling example DB servers, file, servers, APP servers for this server, vertical scaling is best suited

Horizontal scaling-it will automatically create servers while the load is increasing

Q- what are the different types of route 53 routing policies we do have??

A - latency -latency means it will take the nearest data centre. To avoid the latency.

Failover -if one server goes down, the secondary server will take over

Weighted -example, there are a lot of uses in India due to large scale users. All the heads are going to US using latency to avoid such things we need to load balancing that is waited.

Geo location -Jio location will strictly follow the band rules, Indian New Zealand should go to India only and US region. User should go to US only.

Multivalues -we can give multiple server IP in multi values, specifically, it takes any one of the IP.

Q- what is CDN ?

A- a large portion of all internet content is delivering through CNCN is nothing but content deliver network

Example, if you are in India and want to watch the same brand in USA store, we will experienced bit slow response to avoid such issues. CDN will store cache version of the US website content in multiple geographical locations across the world also called as point of presence.

Q- How do you clear cash memory in cloud front ?

A - go to cloud front under cloud front. We do have something called distributions under distributions. > invalidation enter /\* and then clear.

Q- what are the different types of databases we do have?

A - structure database-RDBMS MYSQL , Oracle MSSQLPostgress mariaDB Arora.

Structure database, AWS dynamo DB AWS document DB

In memory database, elastic cache, AWS redshift

Q- what is systems, Manager ?

A- Systems, Manager is mainly used to centrally, manage the global configuration settings by using parameter store.

Q- what is the difference between AWS cloud Trail and AWS Config?

A - yes, we can monitor all the API activities activities such as logging in from console or CL or any third-party application like Packer and Terraform, everything all events will be recorded by the cloud Trail

Cloud config-Cloud conflict, especially used to tracking the detail changes which is happening on your resources. For example, if we make a 3,4 changes in your resources, you have a separate plural event, but in cloud conflict, it will show you consolidated overview. What are the changes it’s been performed.

Q- what is elastic beanstalk?

A - elastic beans, stock is the service for deploying and scaling web application and service. Upload your code and elastic bet will automatically handle the deployment from load balance into health monitoring.

Q- what is blue green deployment?

A- we had an application which is currently running and that application had an new updates. So all the traffic will be hit to load balance, so we will direct the traffic to the already existing application. Once testing part is done. Then we will route the traffic to the newly deployed application.

DevOps Questions

Q what are the types of branching strategies you do follow?

A - we are following future branching strategies, which are main and integration which are long live branches
Main always points to the production comments, and the total code is available in the integration branch
So whenever we want to work on Application code, we create branch from the integration we developed, and we check if the pipeline is running smooth or amount. Once it is good, we will raise the PR.
If the PR conditions that the code is working, then only we merge.
So once marking with the integration, if it’s good, then we will check with the rest of the teams like QA pre-product production
So once it is succeeded in the production master points to the committee, so we point the tip and tag as version 1.0
By doing this, whatever the conflict, I will get, I will sit with the developers, and I will do the necessary things.

Q What is Git and why is it used?

A - Git is a tool for tracking changes in code. It helps developers work together and keep track of every change.

Explain the difference between Git and GitHub.

##################Terraform########################

What is terraform and what are the advantages?

Terraformism is an infrastructure automation tool, which is mainly used to deploy/provision our cloud infrastructure.
The main advantages inform is automation dry checks, validation of code, with the help of state file or TF. We can deploy another infra.

Q - how to change a configuration file, which is already created using a terraform-

A- Terraform import

Q - What is the use case of Terraform statefile.tf And where you save it?

A- Terraform maintenance state file that map share current state of your infrastructure along with the configuration file
So state files are basically in local machine for the back ups or in the remote location. S3 with strategies with the help of dynamo DB table locking policy.

Q-let’s say you have lost your Terraform state file. What will you do?

A- basically, statefile will contain very critical information. So keeping such files under locking system is always the best practice. Imagine you have lost the file so performs don’t know that there is an existing environment because the state file has been deleted. So if we deploy again with the source file, there will be a drastic overlapping and we and we see cross pollinations. so the best option is to use share of import.

Q- what are the main features in terraform?

A- terraform can manage infrastructure in multiple cloud platforms. Terraform uses HashiCorp language which is user readable.

Q What are the different types of terraform modules?

A- There are multiple modules, but I have knowledge on route modules, publish modules . route modules which consists of all resources defined in the TF file which is the main working directory. Example it contains main.Tf or variable.tf or any additional terraform config Files.

The route modules will be considered as main configuration for your entire infra project.

Q- have you know what is remote backend?

A- remote back in is a place where we store all our TF state files which can be shared to other developers of infrastructure

Q- What are terraform workspace?

A- it is allows us to manage separate file for each workspace.

Q-What is Ansible and what is it used for?

A-Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and orchestration. It simplifies IT operations by automating repetitive tasks.

Q-Explain the difference between Ansible and other configuration management tools like Chef or Puppet.

A-Ansible uses an agentless architecture, relying on SSH and Python to execute tasks on remote servers. Chef and Puppet use an agent-based approach where agents need to be installed on managed nodes.

Q-What are Ansible playbooks?

A-Ansible playbooks are YAML files that define a set of tasks to be executed. They automate configurations, deployments, and orchestration of tasks across managed nodes.

Q-How do you run an Ansible playbook?

A-You run an Ansible playbook using the ansible-playbook command followed by the playbook filename. For example, ansible-playbook site.yml.

Q-What is an Ansible role?

A-An Ansible role is a way to organize playbooks and other files in a reusable structure. It encapsulates tasks, variables, templates, and files into a directory structure.

Q-How do you install Ansible on your local machine?

A-Ansible can be installed using package managers like apt, yum, or brew depending on your operating system. For example, sudo apt-get install ansible on Ubuntu.

Q-What is an inventory file in Ansible?

A-An inventory file in Ansible lists the IP addresses or hostnames of managed nodes (servers) that Ansible will work with. It defines the targets for Ansible playbooks and ad-hoc commands.

Q-Explain the difference between Ansible ad-hoc commands and playbooks.

A-Ad-hoc commands are run from the command-line to perform quick tasks on remote nodes (ansible command). Playbooks are YAML files that provide a more structured and reusable way to automate tasks.

Q-How does Ansible handle idempotency?

A-Ansible ensures idempotency by only applying changes when necessary. If a task has already been completed successfully, Ansible will not reapply it unless changes are made to the task or its configuration.

Q-What is the Ansible Galaxy?

A-Ansible Galaxy is a website and command-line tool for finding, reusing, and sharing Ansible roles. It provides a repository of community-contributed roles that can be used to extend Ansible functionality.
