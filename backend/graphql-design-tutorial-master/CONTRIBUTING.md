Contributions are welcome; however, this tutorial reflects rules specific to Shopify and
any substantial changes to those will primarily happen internally and not through external contributions.

If you do want to propose a substantial change, please consider opening an issue first
to ensure it aligns to the direction of the project (and potentially save yourself some time!).

Please read and follow our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.
