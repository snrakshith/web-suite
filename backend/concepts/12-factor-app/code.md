Certainly! Here's a practical example showcasing each factor using Node.js:

1. Codebase:
   Create a new directory for your microservice and initialize it as a Git repository.

   ```bash
   mkdir my-microservice
   cd my-microservice
   git init
   ```

2. Dependencies:
   Use npm to manage dependencies. Create a `package.json` file to declare your dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   npm install express
   ```

3. Config:
   Use environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file and use the `dotenv` package to load the variables.

   ```bash
   npm install dotenv
   ```

   In your code:

   ```javascript
   require("dotenv").config();

   const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
   // Use process.env for other configuration variables
   ```

4. Backing services:
   Connect to a database using environment variables. For example, with MongoDB and the `mongoose` package:

   ```bash
   npm install mongoose
   ```

   In your code:

   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require("mongoose");
   mongoose.connect(process.env.DB_URL);
   ```

5. Build, release, run:
   Use npm scripts to define build, release, and run commands in `package.json`.

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "build": "npm install",
     "release": "zip -r release.zip .",
     "start": "node index.js"
   }
   ```

6. Processes:
   Use Node.js event-driven model for your microservice implementation.

7. Port binding:
   Use Express.js to expose your API through a specific port.

   ```javascript
   const express = require("express");
   const app = express();

   app.get("/", (req, res) => {
     res.send("Hello World!");
   });

   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

8. Concurrency:
   Use a process manager like PM2 to handle multiple instances of your Node.js microservice.

   ```bash
   npm install pm2 -g
   pm2 start index.js -i max
   ```

9. Disposability:
   Ensure fast startup and graceful shutdown using appropriate signal handling.

   ```javascript
   process.on("SIGINT", () => {
     // Perform cleanup tasks
     process.exit();
   });
   ```

10. Dev/prod parity:
    Use Docker to create a consistent environment. Create a `Dockerfile`:

    ```dockerfile
    FROM node:14

    WORKDIR /app

    COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
    RUN npm install --production

    COPY . .

    EXPOSE 3000

    CMD [ "node", "index.js" ]
    ```

11. Logs:
    Use a logging library like `winston` to log events.

    ```bash
    npm install winston
    ```

    In your code:

    ```javascript
    const winston = require("winston");

    const logger = winston.createLogger({
      transports: [
        new winston.transports.Console(),
        new winston.transports.File({ filename: "app.log" }),
      ],
    });

    logger.info("Application started");
    ```

12. Admin processes:
    Create separate scripts for administrative tasks.
    ```javascript
    // admin-task.js
    const mongoose = require("mongoose");
    // Perform admin task using mongoose or other tools
    ```

I hope this example helps you understand how each factor can be applied practically in a Node.js microservice. Remember that these examples showcase the concepts, and

you may need to modify them to fit your specific use case.
